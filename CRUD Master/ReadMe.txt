This project is a simple yet functional reactive web application developed using the OutSystems platform. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the Users table.

Thanks to OutSystems' low-code approach, this application enables fast and efficient development, aiming to simplify the management of user data.

The project was created both as part of my personal learning journey and as a practical example for working with CRUD-based applications.
